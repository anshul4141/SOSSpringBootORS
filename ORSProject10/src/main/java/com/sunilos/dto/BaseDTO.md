### Explanation

1. **Class-Level Javadoc**: Provides a high-level overview of the purpose of `BaseDTO`, including its author, version, and inheritance structure.
2. **`@MappedSuperclass` Annotation**: Marks the class as a mapped superclass so that subclasses inherit its mappings without creating a database table for it.
3. **Fields**:
   - `id`: Uses Hibernateâ€™s `GenericGenerator` for an incrementing ID strategy.
   - `createdBy`, `modifiedBy`: Track the user who created or last modified the record.
   - `createdDatetime`, `modifiedDatetime`: Automatically set creation and modification timestamps.
4. **Getter and Setter Methods**: Provide access and modification for each field, with JavaDocs explaining the purpose of each method.
5. **`compareTo` Method**: Compares `BaseDTO` instances based on a `getValue` method (presumably defined in subclasses). This method enables sorting for DTOs.
